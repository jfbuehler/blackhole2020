## About

I designed this project in my spare time...so it is as such -- no promises of features or perfection -- but if it brings more joy to the internet, then I am glad.
That said, I strive to keep the core functionality bug-free and working solid. 
To date the secure erasure has been tested on Terabytes of my own SSD data and looks good on MacOS. 

Windows is still a WIP (work in progress) and needs some more loving to keep up. 

I use this project as a practice ground for best-practices, coding standards, learning new techniques, and expressing joy. 
So, its my hope that while it may be small in scope, the code is tight and well designed, bug free (mostly) and achieves its purpose with grace.
That said, if you do stumble upon this repo, you are free to explore and suggest or fork and never talk to me :) Whatever your heart desires! 
May this project and the way I've implemented certain things inspire you to greater heights. 

Future growth includes:
[] - Adding tests
[] - Adding localizations 
[] - Adding new features as they become interesting
