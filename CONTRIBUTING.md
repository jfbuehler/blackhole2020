# Introduction

### Thanks for being interested in this source code project ðŸ˜„

>First off, thank you for considering contributing. 

### Guidelines

>Pretty simple here...just be nice, creative, interested, curious. There is no high and lofty goal with this project -- that is its beauty. 

### Kinds of Contributions That Are Best

Really, anything you think of is open to discussion. It may not all make sense, but, you can always fork it then :) 

### Contributions NOT to send

Nothing that violates anyones privacy or introduces massive framework dependencies. 

# Ground Rules

> Responsibilities
> * If possible, and you know how, ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows + Mac. Not a huge deal breaker if not. 
> * Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. No changes without reviewed PRs. 
> * Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
> * Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. Basically this -> [Python Community Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/).

# Getting started

How you write this is up to you, but some things you may want to include:
    * Send a pull request indicating that you have a CLA on file.

# How to report a bug

> If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email @jfbuehler instead.
